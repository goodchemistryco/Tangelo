\section{Quantum circuit rotation gate convention}

This package is such that the Rx, Ry and Rz gates follow the same angle sign and phase convention as projectQ.
Qulacs has opposite signs: if you are trying to make an abstract circuit equivalent to a qulacs circuit coming from
previous work, please ensure your RX, RY, RZ abstract gates have now the opposite side.
Qiskit Rz gate differs from the other simulators by a phase, which does not impact simulation results but may show
a slightly different state vector.
