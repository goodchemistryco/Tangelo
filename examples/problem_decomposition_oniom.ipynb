    "## 1. Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of our implementation of the ONIOM method ([Chem. Rev. 2015, 115, 12, 5678â€“5796](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr5004419)), a hybrid QM/MM technique. The ONIOM method enables the user to leverage the accuracy of computationally-expensive chemistry methods, only where expressly necessary, thus enabling us to investigate the applicability of quantum algorithms to more industrially-relevant problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying large molecules, and their interactions with other systems, the use of computationally-expensive techniques is often not only intractable, but also unnecessary. For example, when considering the interaction between a water molecule and a functional group appended to a large graphite flake, it is not reasonable to attempt to treat this entire system at the level of something like Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) or Coupled Cluster methods (ex: CCSD(T)). In such situations, the ONIOM method enables us to target the fragments of the problem at hand with the most sophisticated techniques we can afford, while relegating the rest of the problem to more affordable computational methods. This method can become particularly advantageous when we are interested in energy differences, where the contribution to the total molecular energy from the relatively inert volumes becomes negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the energy evaluated by ONIOM (with a low- and high-accuracy methods) is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{ONIOM} = E_{All}^{Low} + \\sum_{i=1}^N (E_{Fragment\\ i}^{High} - E_{Fragment\\ i}^{Low})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $E_{All}$, $E_{Fragment\\ i}$ are respectively the energy of the whole system and the energy of a fragment labelled $i$. The general procedure for ONIOM is as follows. The user identifies a system of interest and a low-cost method is used to compute its total energy ($E_{All}^{Low}$). Subsequently, a subset of the molecule is defined as a model fragment and it is isolated by using an atom (or a functional group) to keep the valence shell fully populated. $E_{Fragment\\ i}^{Low}$ is computed for the fragment using the same low-cost method as used initially for the whole system, and a high-cost method ($E_{Fragment\\ i}^{High}$). The difference in energy between the high-cost and low-cost methods ($E_{Fragment\\ i}^{High} - E_{Fragment\\ i}^{Low}$) is then added to our total energy. This way, we can interpret the ONIOM method as an iterative procedure where the error associated with our low-cost solver is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above is formulated to allow us to expand ONIOM beyond a single fragment. In principle, many such fragments can be defined to progressively improve the accuracy or efficiency of the calculations. This may apply to when we have more than one active site on our large molecule, or where an incremental strategy can be utilized to further mitigate errors associated with using our low-cost method in the vicinity of our active region."

    "## 2. Use case - water absorption<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Why is water absorption a relevant scientific problem?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"21\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "New technologies are in need of scientific insights on the interaction of materials with water. As illustrated below, many applications would benefit from these insights. The first example comes from the water scarcity in some regions of the world. One explored way of circumventing this issue is to design a device capable of condensing water. This requires materials able to attract water molecules, like a magnet, even at low humidity. Another predominant problem for water accessibility is its purification. If a material is able to selectively retain water molecules and no other chemical entity, one could perform purification and thus convert saline water into potable water. Lastly, interaction of water with buildings and bridges can potentially have an important impact: long-term durability of the materials used could be of significant interest to urban communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Water absorption problems](img/water_absorption_problems.png \"Water absorption problems\")\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these problems can be approached from a bottom-up perspective, with numerical simulation from different angles. New material discoveries are thus accelerated by insights provided by material modeling. In the notebook, we tackle a specific case of water absorption with ONIOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why using ONIOM? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"22\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the water absorption study, a single molecule can be positioned near a chemical group to identify the interaction force and optimal heteroatom-hydrogen distance. One can then decide to add more water molecules, for a more faithful modeling of the target use-case, thus disabling the hydrogen bond by stabilizing the relevant water molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the system size is very far from the thermodynamic limit, computational resources remain a constraint: using problem decomposition mitigates this issue. With the help of ONIOM, we can target a specific interaction to compute with a high-accuracy method, while considering an environment with a lower-cost electronic structure solver. This addition of a chemical environment can establish an easier link between simulation and experimental results, while keeping compute time practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 How is it done? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"23\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining part of this section, we will see how to combine the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with Hartree-Fock (HF) to compute the ground state energy of a water/carboxylic acid system. We will focus our attention on the hydrogen bond between the COOH group and a water molecule, as seen in the figure below. The numbers on the right correspond to the selected atoms via their indices in the coordinates file. Internally, the `ONIOMProblemDecomposition` solver adds a hydrogen atom between atoms 0 and 1 to preserve the valence bond completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/ONIOM_example.png\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to specifically target the H2O-COOH interaction. We will use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a Unitary Coupled-Cluster Single and Double excitation (UCCSD) ansatz. The basis set for this fragment is 6-31G(d,p). The rest of the system is simulated using Hartree-Fock (HF) with a minimal basis set (STO-3G).\n",

    "The next thing to do is to define a geometry and some options for the desired solvers. As a side note, the quantum resources for this subsystem are still too demanding for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We reduce the amount of resources by freezing molecular orbitals in the system: in our simple case, the fragment has been reduced to a HOMO-LUMO problem. This allows us to use UCC3 as the variational ansatz for VQE, as it is equivalent to UCCSD, but shallower (by removing redundant excitation terms) and can be applied to two-level systems. As progress is made in the development of more capable quantum devices, less agressive resource reduction could be chosen to increase the accuracy, at the cost of more challenging computation."
