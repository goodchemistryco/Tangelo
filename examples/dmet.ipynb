    "One of the main objectives of quantum chemistry calculations in the area of materials science is to solve the electronic structure problem, $H\\Psi=E\\Psi$, as accurately as possible, in order to accelerate the materials design process. In the first example, the butane molecule is shown as an example. \n",

    "The computational cost for performing accurate calculations of the electronic structure of molecules, however, is usually very expensive. For example, the cost of performing the full CI calculation scales exponentially on a classical computer as the size of the system increases. Therefore, when we target large-sized molecules, those relevant for industry problems, it becomes essential to employ an appropriate strategy for reducing the computational cost. The difficulty is to employ a strategy that consolidate accuracy while reducing computational costs when performing electronic structure calculations. Next, we will developp one of such strategy called Density matrix embedding theory (DMET)."

    "## 2. Theory of DMET <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to decompose a molecular system into its constituent fragments and its environment. Each fragment are treated independently and recombined at the end to recover the full molecular energy. This has the advantages of cutting down the maximal computational complexity depending on the biggest fragment and being naturally implemented on parrallel computer. On the other side, the fragmenting comes at the cost of reducing accuraccy of the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the environment is calculated using a less-accurate method than will be used to calculate the electronic structure of a fragment. Then, the electronic structure problem for a given fragment is solved to a high degree of accuracy, which includes the quantum mechanical effects of the environment. The quantum mechanical description is updated (i.e., solved iteratively as shown below) by incorporating the just-performed highly accurate calculation. In the following schematic illustration, the molecule shown above is decomposed into fragments. Each molecular fragment CH$_\\mathrm{3}$ and CH$_\\text{2}$ are the fragments chosen for the electronic structure calculation, with the rest of the molecular system being the surrounding environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/iterations.png\" alt=\"iterations\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "One successful decomposition approach is the DMET method. The DMET method decomposes a molecule into fragments, and each fragment is treated as an open quantum system that is entangled with each of the other fragments, all taken together to be that fragment's surrounding environment (or \"bath\"). In this framework, the electronic structure of a given fragment is obtained by solving the following Hamiltonian, by using a highly accurate quantum chemistry method, such as the full CI method or a coupled-cluster method.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_{I}=\\sum^{\\text{frag}+\\text{bath}}_{rs}  \\left[ h_{rs} + \\sum_{mn} \\left[ (rs|mn) - (rn|ms) \\right] D^{\\text{(mf)env}}_{mn} \\right] a_{r}^{\\dagger}a_{s} + \\sum_{pqrs}^{\\text{frag}+\\text{bath}} (pq|rs) a_{p}^{\\dagger}a_{r}^{\\dagger}a_{s}a_{q} - \\mu\\sum_{r}^{\\text{frag}} a_{r}^{\\dagger}a_{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression $\\sum_{mn} \\left[ (rs|mn) - (rn|ms) \\right] D^{\\text{(mf)env}}_{mn}$ describes the quantum mechanical effects of the environment on the fragment, where $D^{\\text{(mf)env}}_{mn}$ is the mean-field electronic density obtained by solving the Hartree&ndash;Fock equation. The quantum mechanical effects from the environment are incorporated through the one-particle term of the Hamiltonian. The extra term $\\mu\\sum_{r}^{\\text{frag}} a_{r}^{\\dagger}a_{r}$ ensures, through the adjustment of $\\mu$, that the number of electrons in all of the fragments, taken together, becomes equal to the total number of electrons in the entire system."
