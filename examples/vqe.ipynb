    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) \\[[Peruzzo_et_al.,_2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3061),  [McClean_et_al.,_2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04279)\\] has been introduced as a hybrid quantum&ndash;classical algorithm for simulating quantum systems. Some examples of quantum simulation using VQE include solving the molecular electronic Schr√∂dinger equation and model systems in condensed matter physics (e.g., Fermi&ndash; and Bose&ndash;Hubbard models). In this notebook, we focus on VQE within the context of solving the molecular electronic structure problem for the ground-state energy of a molecular system. The second-quantized Hamiltonian of such a system, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, assumes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{H} = h_{\\text{nuc}} + \\sum_{p,q} h^{p}_{q} \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_p \\hat{a}_q + \\sum_{p,q,r,s} h^{pq}_{rs} \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_p \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_q \\hat{a}_s \\hat{a}_r\\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $h_{\\text{nuc}}$ denotes the nuclear repulsion energy. The coefficients $h^{p}_{q}$ and $h^{pq}_{rs}$ are obtained by solving a mean-field problem. The Hamiltonian is then transformed into the qubit basis (e.g., Jordan&ndash;Wigner, Bravyi&ndash;Kitaev). This means that it is expressed entirely in terms of operators acting on qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{H} = h_{\\text{nuc}} + \\sum_{\\substack{p \\\\ \\alpha}} h_{p}^{\\alpha} \\sigma_p^{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\substack{p,q \\\\ \\alpha,\\beta}} h_{pq}^{\\alpha\\beta}\\sigma_p^{\\alpha}\\otimes\\sigma_{q}^{\\beta} + \\sum_{\\substack{p,q,r \\\\ \\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma}}h_{pqr}^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\sigma_p^{\\alpha}\\otimes\\sigma_{q}^{\\beta}\\otimes\\sigma_r^{\\gamma} + \\ldots \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression, the $\\sigma_p^\\alpha$ are Pauli matrices ($\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$), acting on the $p$-th qubit. We now consider a trial wavefunction ansatz $\\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle = U(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert 0 \\rangle$ that depends on $m$ parameters defining $\\vec{\\theta}=(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_m)$, which enter a unitary operator that acts on the reference (i.e., mean-field) state $\\vert 0 \\rangle$. The variational principle dictates that we can minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E = \\min_{\\vec{\\theta}} \\frac{\\langle \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert \\hat{H} \\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle} \\geq E_{\\text{gs}}\\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "to determine the optimal set of variational parameters. The energy thus computed will be an upper bound to the true ground-state energy $E_{\\text{gs}}$. Once a suitable variational trial ansatz has been chosen (e.g., a unitary coupled-cluster ansatz, a heuristic ansatz), we must provide a suitable set of initial guess parameters. If our ansatz is written in according to the second quantization picture, we must also transform it into the qubit basis before proceeding. We must also apply other approximations (e.g., Trotter&ndash;Suzuki) to render it amenable for translation into a quantum circuit. The resulting qubit form of the ansatz can then be translated into a quantum circuit and, thus, able to be implemented on quantum hardware. Once the initial state has been prepared using a quantum circuit, energy measurements are performed using quantum hardware or an appropriate simulation tool. The energy value obtained is the sum of the measurements of the expectation values of each of the terms that contribute to the Hamiltonian (assuming the wavefunction has been normalized to unity):\n",
