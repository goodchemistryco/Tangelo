    "# ADAPT-VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAPT-VQE was introduced by [Grimsley et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10988-2) as a solution to the often impracticably deep, and not necessarily accurate, static VQE circuits. In ansatze like UCCSD, one easily reaches the order of thousands of gates, even for modestly sized molecules. In UCCSD and its generalized UCCGSD, the number of fermionic excitations in the ansatz scales like $\\mathcal{O}(N^2M^2)$, and $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ respectively. Here $N$ refers to the number of spin-orbitals in the problem basis, and $M$ the number of electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ADAPT-VQE, an ansatz which approximates not UCCSD/UCCGSD, but in fact FCI, is built iteratively. Over a series of cycles, the ansatz circuit is grown to achieve an approximation to FCI with a minimal number of circuit elements. In this way, ADAPT-VQE is a meta-VQE. At each step, a new ansatz is defined, and its parameters optimized according to conventional VQE. As the cycles proceed, the ansatz grows in both complexity and expressibility. This algorithm comes at the expense of a significant increase in measurement overhead. In order to identify the best operator to append to the present ansatz circuit, a large number of measurements are performed to rank the available operators in order of their ability to further reduce the ansatz state energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the implementation of this algorithm, by taking advantage of the tools available through the qSDK. "

    "## Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAPT-VQE relies on three principal steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct generator pool $\\{P_i\\}$, a set of available operators from which we will iteratively construct the ansatz.\n",
    "2. Rank operators by evaluating the gradient for each operator in the pool $\\frac{\\partial E^{(k)}}{\\partial \\theta_i} = \\langle \\psi_k|[H,P_i]|\\psi_k\\rangle$. Exit if the largest partial derivative is less than some cutoff.\n",
    "3. Append $U_k = \\mathrm{exp}[i\\theta_k P_k]$(index) to the ansatz $U=\\prod_k U_k(\\theta_k)$, and optimize $\\langle H\\rangle$ using VQE.\n",
    "4. Return to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two obvious avenues along which one can be creative in the implementation of ADAPT-VQE--these are the selection of the operator pool $\\{P_i\\}$, and the ranking strategy. Above, we have specified that we are using the gradient to perform this ranking procedure. To my knowledge this is the only method which has been used previously, and we will continue to do so here. Regarding the choice of operator pool, the original authors used the elements of the UCCGSD, i.e. the single, double fermionic excitations. Subsequent work has focused on qubit-native operators, and we'll follow this strategy as well. Although the UCCGSD allows for high accuracy with a small number of cycles (and consequently very few variational parameters), the circuit remains very deep, as each excitation consists of many multi-qubit Pauli rotations.

    "## Hamiltonian-Inspired Qubit-ADAPT\n",
    "We are going to use the Hamiltonian to establish a set of pool generators to use in our implementation of ADAPT-VQE. For each term in the Hamiltonian which acts on a distinct combination of qubits, we'll add a pool operator which is guaranteed to have a non-zero commutator with respect to H, and therefore a finite gradient. This will give us a fairly compact set of operators in the pool, all of which are likely to be useful in our ansatz construction. To do this, we will scan through all terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. For each, we will identify the Pauli operators associated with electronic excitation (X and Y gates). We discard Z gates from the Pauli string. If the number of Y gates in a string is even, we can use this to construct an excitation pool element that preserves T-symmetry, by flipping one of the other X gates to a Y, or a Y to an X. Below, we'll flip the first X or Y to its partner."

    "We note that ADAPT-VQE has run with 2 more variational parameters than UCCSD-VQE. This introduces additional overhead to the classical optimizer, which must find an optimal solution within a higher-dimensional space. However, the number of variational parameters for ADAPT-VQE is directly dependent on the number of cycles over which ADAPT is run. We then have the opportunity to compromise between optimization complexity and ansatz expressivity by limiting the number of cycles, and therefore the number of variational parameters (and gate number and depth) associated with a computation. This flexibility in resource requirements is then an important advantage for the ADAPT-VQE algorithm over static ansatze."

    "In this notebook, we've explored a simple implementation of the ADAPT-VQE algorithm, using tools available through the qSDK. We have demonstrated how we can leverage these tools to reduce the effort involved in prototyping new quantum algorithms. This allows the user to focus exclusively on the specific components relevant to their research objectives, without getting bogged down in re-building standard infrastructure from scratch. \n",
