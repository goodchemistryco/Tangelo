    "# ADAPT-VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAPT-VQE was introduced by [Grimsley et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10988-2) as a solution to the often impracticably deep, and not necessarily accurate, static VQE circuits. In ansatze like UCCSD, one easily reaches the order of thousands of gates, even for modestly sized molecules. In UCCSD and its generalized UCCGSD, the number of fermionic excitations in the ansatz scales like $\\mathcal{O}(N^2M^2)$, and $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ respectively. Here $N$ refers to the number of spin-orbitals in the problem basis, and $M$ the number of electrons.\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "In ADAPT-VQE, an ansatz which approximates not UCCSD/UCCGSD, but in fact FCI, is built iteratively. Over a series of cycles, the ansatz circuit is grown to achieve an approximation to FCI with a minimal number of circuit elements. In this way, ADAPT-VQE is a meta-VQE. At each step, a new ansatz is defined, and its parameters optimized according to conventional VQE. As the cycles proceed, the ansatz grows in both complexity and expressibility. This algorithm comes at the expense of a significant increase in measurement overhead. In order to identify the best operator to append to the present ansatz circuit, a large number of measurements are performed to rank the available operators in order of their ability to further reduce the ansatz state energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the implementation of this algorithm, by using the implementation available in qSDK. "

    "ADAPT-VQE relies on three principal steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the UCCGSD pool $\\{P_i\\}$, a set of available operators from which we will iteratively construct the ansatz.\n",
    "2. Rank operators by evaluating the gradient for each operator in the pool $\\frac{\\partial E^{(k)}}{\\partial \\theta_i} = \\langle \\psi_k|[H,P_i]|\\psi_k\\rangle$. Exit if the largest partial derivative is less than some cutoff or max iterations have been reached.\n",
    "3. Append $U_k = \\mathrm{exp}[i\\theta_k P_k]$(index) to the ansatz $U=\\prod_k U_k(\\theta_k)$, and optimize $\\langle H\\rangle$ using VQE.\n",
    "4. Return to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UCCGSD pool allows for high accuracy with a small number of cycles (and consequently very few variational parameters), the circuit remains very deep, as each excitation consists of many multi-qubit Pauli rotations. "

    "In this notebook, we've explored a simple implementation of the ADAPT-VQE algorithm, using the implementation available in qSDK. It is clear that the number of parameters required for accurate results can be made much smaller than with a standard ansatz. If you wish to look at a different implementation of Adapt-VQE using a Qubit Hamiltonian, please look at the qubit_adapt.ipynb notebook in the user_notebooks folder. The goal there is to reduce the number of gates instead of reducing the number of variational parameters."
